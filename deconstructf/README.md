# deconstructf

one of the worst ctfs i have ever played... maybe one of the worst of all time

here we go:

for clarity, this is what they scored on the bad ctf bingo card:

they stole challs, which is downright unacceptable. it really doesn't take too much effort to make a unique chall, so i am disappointed

i would do writeups, but they dont even keep the challs up for some time after the ctf :(

not writing writeups, sadly, but keeping this for future use / evidence / blackmail purposes
