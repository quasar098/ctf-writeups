## solution

starbucks is really really generic, and i tried searching for some phrases and words present in the picture, but found nothing

so anyways, i used the sha512 hash and a starbucks location dataset to brute force hashes with a custom formatted wordlist

the dataset i used was `https://github.com/chrismeller/StarbucksLocations` (amazing dataset, contains so many starbucks locations!!)
