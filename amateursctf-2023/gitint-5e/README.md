## solution

we take a look at the organization, and see [this](https://github.com/les-amateurs/more-CTFd-mods) suspicious repo with weird things

we look at the [commit history](https://github.com/les-amateurs/more-CTFd-mods/commits/main)

these are the first few commits

this one was incredibly easy, but gitint 7d was quite the nightmare
