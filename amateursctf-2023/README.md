# amateursCTF 2023

keep in mind i did this ctf solo (all of my team members are busy), but I spent pretty much all my time for the 5 days of the ctf

i managed to solve like 27/66, which i think is pretty good for someone of my calibre (D tier calibre, especially compared to others)

the most guessy ctf of them all

also gitint sucks btw

i ended up placing 7/69 (90%) on high school bracket, and 48/914 (95%) overall, which i think is not bad
