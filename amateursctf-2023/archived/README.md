## solution

this challenge was extremely dumb and poor quality

i first spent a few hours stalking the admins social media profiles, amateurs CTF website, ctftime, discord profiles, etc

then, i looked at everything on the wayback machine because that's the "internet archive"

apparently, you can search through the entirety of the internet archive with just a single click using the search tool, which is really really dumb as a challenge

i dont even understand, how is it possible (how does it work is better question) to search multiple copies of the entire internet (over 40 million gigabytes) in less than 0.5 seconds???? how???

this took me around 4 hours to figure out, but i was glad i was able to solve this
