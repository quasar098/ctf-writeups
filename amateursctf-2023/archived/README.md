## solution

this challenge was extremely dumb and poor quality

i first spent a few hours stalking the admins social media profiles, amateurs CTF website, ctftime, discord profiles, etc

then, i looked at everything on the wayback machine because that's the "internet archive"

apparently, you can search through the entirety of the internet archive with just a single click using the search tool, which is really really dumb as a challenge

this took me around 4 hours to figure out, but i was glad i was able to solve this
